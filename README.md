## This is my daily code repository.

Every day I solve some coding problem sent by email through "Daily Interview Pro" mailing list, 
Generously proposed by the one and only TechLead ! ;) Thank you man. 

Mostly Python so far, pretty convenient for most problems.

Average resolution time so far : 30 to 40 minutes. 
I'll try to keep better tracking through regular detailed commits (started late).
